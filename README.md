### Hi there, I'm [Orhan Bilge](https://www.orhanbilge.com/) ðŸ‘‹

I was born in Istanbul in 1994. Between the years 1996-2004 I returned to Turkey after living in Germany. My constant interest in technology continued here as well and I quickly adapted to the software world in a short time.

Although I have been interested in various software languages over time, I am currently actively working on developing web applications. In addition, I always adapt to new generation technologies, and I am sensitive and insistent on staying up to date.
